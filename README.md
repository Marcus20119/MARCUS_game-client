## Project Description

The Mark Game website is a simple platform I developed for learning Redux and Typescript. It includes 2 game: `Wordle` and `Tic Tac Toe`

Wordle is a popular online game where players try to guess a five-letter word by entering different letter combinations. The game is simple and addictive, with players having six chances to guess the word correctly before losing the game. The game is available for free online and has gained a massive following on social media platforms like Twitter. The popularity of Wordle can be attributed to its simple yet challenging gameplay, making it a great way to pass the time and improve one's vocabulary skills.

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper and pencil game that has been played by people of all ages for generations. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns placing X's and O's in empty squares, with the aim of getting three in a row. Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that requires strategy and quick thinking to outsmart the opponent. In recent years, the game has become widely available online, and many websites offer variations of the game, including multiplayer and AI-powered versions. Tic Tac Toe remains a beloved game for its simplicity, accessibility, and fun gameplay.
